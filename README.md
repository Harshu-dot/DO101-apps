# Introduction to OpenShift Application
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a containerized application platform that allows enterprises to accelerate and streamline application development, delivery, and deployment on-premise or in the cloud. As OpenShift and Kubernetes continue to be widely adopted by enterprises, developers are increasingly required to understand how to develop, build, and deploy applications with a containerized application platform. While some developers are interested in managing the underlying OpenShift infrastructure, most developers want to focus their time and energy on developing applications, and leveraging OpenShift for its simple building, deployment, and scaling capabilities.
Introduction to OpenShift Applications (DO101) introduces developers to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

## Course Objectives
